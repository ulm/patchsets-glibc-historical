nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/fork.c : __libc_fork()

Reset the refcntr for the fork-handlers in the child process to 1.

	The refcntr may have been bumped up by the *OTHER* thread(s) doing a fork() in the parent process. This would leave the child with an incorrect refcntr for the fork-handlers leading us to wait for non-existing threads to drop the refcntr while doing __unregister_atfork(). Since there is only one thread in the child process, we reset it to 1, to reflect the actual count.
