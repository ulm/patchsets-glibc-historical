.TH PTHREAD_KILL_OTHER_THREADS_NP 3 LinuxThreads

.SH NAME
pthread_kill_other_threads_np \- terminate all threads in program except calling thread

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <pthread.h>

.BI "void pthread_kill_other_threads_np(void);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "pthread_kill_other_threads_np"
is a non-portable LinuxThreads extension.
It causes all threads in the program to terminate immediately, except
the calling thread which proceeds normally. It is intended to be
called just before a thread calls one of the 
.B "exec"
functions,
e.g. 
.BR "execve" (2).

Termination of the other threads is not performed through
.BR "pthread_cancel" (3)
and completely bypasses the cancellation
mechanism. Hence, the current settings for cancellation state and
cancellation type are ignored, and the cleanup handlers are not
executed in the terminated threads.

.SH BUGS

According to POSIX 1003.1c, a successful 
.B "exec*"
in one of the threads
should terminate automatically all other threads in the program.
This behavior is not yet implemented in LinuxThreads.
Calling 
.B "pthread_kill_other_threads_np"
before 
.B "exec*"
achieves much
of the same behavior, except that if 
.B "exec*"
ultimately fails, then
all other threads are already killed.
