.TH locale.gen 5 "July 2005" "Debian GNU/Linux"
.SH "NAME"
locale.gen \- Configuration file for locale-gen
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The file \fB/etc/locale.gen\fP lists the locales that are to be generated
by the \fBlocale-gen\fP command.

Each line is of the form:

<locale> <charset>

where <locale> is one of the locales given in 
.B /usr/share/i18n/locales
and <charset> is one of the character sets listed in 
.B /usr/share/i18n/charmaps

The
.B locale-gen
command will generate all the locales, placing them in
\fB/usr/lib/locale\fP.

Comments start with the hash mark # and may only be on new lines.

Options start with #% (to preserve backwards compatibility).  The only option
currently recognized is \fIno-locale-archive\fR.  This will disable generation
of the locale archive file and instead generate multiple files/directories for
each locale.
