	Hack from Debian to hopefully get sandbox working on mips

<`Kumba> ths: given the SHN_UNDEF thing is a hack, what's the preferred solution?
<ths> For fakeroot the simplest trigger is "fakeroot file /bin/ls".
<ths> `Kumba: I haven't found a better one yet.
<ths> Probably marker symbols around the stub section, and then exclude it from the link map.
<ths> This needs a ld change.
